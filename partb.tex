\subsubsection{Histogram Processing}
The histogram of a digital image with intensity levels in the range [$0, L - 1$] is a discrete function $h(r_k) = n_k$, where $r_k$ is the $k$th intensity value and $n_k$ is the number of pixels in the image with intensity $r_k$. It is common practice to normalize a histogram by dividing each of its components by the total number of pixels in the image, denoted by the product $MN$, where, as usual, $M$ and $N$ are the row and column dimensions of the image. Thus, a normalized histogram is given by $p(r_k) = n_k/MN$, for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., L-1$. Loosely speaking, $p(r_k)$ is an estimate of the probability of occurrence of intensity level $r_k$ in an image. The sum of all components of a normalized histogram is equal to 1.
\subsubsection{Histogram Equalization}
As we know, if we view input intensities $r$ and output intensity $s$ as random variables and their histograms as probability density functions(pdf) $p_r(r)$ and $p_s(s)$.\\
if $p_r(r)$ and $T(r)$ are known and $T(r)$ is continuous and differentiable, then,
$$ p_s(s) = p_r(r)\frac{1}{\left| \frac{ds}{dr} \right|} = p_r(r)\left| \frac{dr}{ds} \right| $$ 
Cumulative distribution function of a random Variable:
$$s = T(r) = (L - 1)\int_0^r p_r(w)dw$$
To fund $p_s(s)$ we have to compute
$$ \frac{ds}{dr} = \frac{dT(r)}{dr} = (L - 1)\frac{d}{dr}\int_0^r p_r(w)dw = (L - 1)p_r(r) $$
Substituting this result:
$$ \frac{ds}{dr} = (L - 1)p_r(r) $$
to 
$$ p_s(s) = p_r(r)\left| \frac{dr}{ds} \right| $$
yields
$$p_s(s) = p_r(r)\left| \frac{1}{(L - 1)p_r(r)} = \frac{1}{L - 1} \right|, 0 \leq s \leq L - 1 $$
The formula for histogram equalisation in the discrete case is given
$$ s_k = T(r_k) = (L - 1)\sum_{j = 0}^k p_r(r_j) = \frac{L - 1}{MN}\sum_{j = 0}^{k} n_j $$

\subsubsection{Computing the histogram of an image}
The original image is shown in Figure \ref{fig:hisoriginal}

To get the histogram of given image, we need to iterate all pixel values of the image and get the frequency of each intencity. Figure \ref{fig:hishist1} shows the output histogram of Figure \ref{fig:hisoriginal} after normalisation.
